# Cursor Rules for Bacura Amal Frontend

## MCP (Model Context Protocol) Configuration

### Next.js MCP Tools
- Use `nextjs_index` to discover running Next.js dev servers
- Use `nextjs_call` to get real-time errors, routes, and diagnostics
- Use `nextjs_docs` for ALL Next.js documentation queries (mandatory)
- Use `browser_eval` for browser automation and testing

### Development Workflow
1. Always start dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Use MCP tools to monitor errors and routes dynamically
3. Fix issues in real-time without restarting server
4. Use browser automation to verify fixes

- Check advisors regularly for security and performance issues

### Dynamic Problem Solving
