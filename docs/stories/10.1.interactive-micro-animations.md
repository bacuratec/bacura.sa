Completed

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** the interface to feel alive and responsive,
**so that** I have a more engaging experience.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Add hover effects to `ServiceCard` and `HowItWorkCard` (lift up, shadow increase).
2. Add page transition animations (fade in/slide up) for main routes.
3. Add button click scale effect (press animation).
4. Use `framer-motion` for smooth transitions.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Install `framer-motion` (already installed).
- [ ] Create a wrapper component `PageTransition` or `FadeIn`.
- [ ] Update `ServiceCard` with hover animations.
- [ ] Update primary buttons with `whileTap={{ scale: 0.95 }}`.

## Dev Notes
- Keep animations subtle (duration ~0.2s - 0.3s).
- Ensure animations don't cause layout shifts.
