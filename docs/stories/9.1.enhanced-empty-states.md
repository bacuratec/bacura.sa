## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** to see helpful illustrations and messages when there is no data to display,
**so that** I understand why the screen is empty and what to do next.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Create a reusable `EmptyState` component.
   - Props: `title`, `description`, `icon/image`, `actionButton` (optional).
2. Implement `EmptyState` in:
   - `NotificationsModal` (when no notifications).
   - `ServiceList` (when no services found).
   - `OrdersTable` / `ExploreRequests` (when no requests found).
3. Style consistent with the application theme.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Design and build `src/components/shared/EmptyState.jsx`.
- [x] Add default SVG illustrations (using `lucide-react` or custom SVGs).
- [x] Integrate into `NotificationsModal.jsx`.
- [x] Integrate into `ExploreRequests.jsx` and `ServiceList.jsx`.

## Dev Notes
- Use `lucide-react` icons with large size and muted colors for defaults.
- Allow passing custom React nodes for flexibility.
