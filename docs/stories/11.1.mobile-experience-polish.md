## Story
**As a** mobile user,
**I want** key flows like the Request Wizard to be easy to use on small screens,
**so that** I can complete tasks without frustration.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Optimize `StepWizard` for mobile:
   - Convert horizontal steps to a compact indicator or scrollable view if needed.
   - Or simplify to "Step X of Y".
2. Review `MobileNavigation` and ensure menu items are easily tappable.
3. Ensure forms have correct input types (numeric for phone/price) to trigger correct keyboard.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Refine `StepWizard` responsive styles (Labels hidden on mobile except current).
- [x] Check `RequestForm` inputs for `inputMode` (Confirmed budget input has correct type).
- [x] Verify `MobileMenu` styles and interactions (Increased hit areas to 44px+).

## Dev Notes
- Use `hidden md:flex` patterns to toggle between desktop/mobile views of complex components.
