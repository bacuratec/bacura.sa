# Story 8.1: Service Request Wizard

## Status
Completed

## Story
**As a** requester,
**I want** to fill out the service request in multiple steps,
**so that** the process is less overwhelming.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Break `RequestForm` into steps:
   - Step 1: Service Selection
   - Step 2: Basic Info (Description)
   - Step 3: Attachments
   - Step 4: Review & Submit
2. Progress bar showing current step.
3. Validation per step before proceeding.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Refactor `RequestForm` to use a step-based state.
- [x] Create `StepWizard` component (reusable).
- [x] Validate each step using Formik's `validateForm` and `setTouched`.
- [x] Add navigation buttons (Next/Back) with validation logic.

## Dev Notes
- Created `src/components/landing-components/request-service/StepWizard.jsx`.
- Refactored `src/components/landing-components/request-service/RequestForm.jsx` to handle 4 steps.
- Split validation schema into an array of schemas per step.
